# bida_twitter_crawler
This crawler allows users to scrape the profile, and social network (i.e., friends and followers) from the handle of a Twitter user of interest. It also scraps for the top 50 most popular tweets containing the keywords "coronavirus" and/or "vaccination".

### Credits
### This Twitter crawler was built by my amazing team (Jacob, Tziqing, Weicheng, Yisheng and myself) from my BIDA course.
